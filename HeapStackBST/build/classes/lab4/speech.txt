when o catiline do you mean to cease abusing our patience how long is that madness of yours still to mock us when is there to be an end of that unbridled audacity of yours swaggering about as it does now do not the nightly guards placed on the palatine hill do not the watches posted throughout the city does not the alarm of the people and the union of all good mendoes not the precaution taken of assembling the senate in this most defensible place do not the looks and countenances of this venerable body here present have any effect upon you do you not feel that your plans are detected do you not see that your conspiracy is already arrested and rendered powerless by the knowledge which every one here possesses of it what is there that you did last night what the night before where is it that you were who was there that you summoned to meet you what design was there which was adopted by you with which you think that any one of us is unacquainted
